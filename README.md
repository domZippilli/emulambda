# Welcome!

I maintain this fork of the original **emulambda** repository for CV purposes only. If you are here to see some of my work, please have a look around and use the "blame" feature to see where I'm culpable! If you are using this fork of **emulambda** in your build and need some changes, please reach out and I'll see if I can help. If you aren't yet using **emulambda** but would like to, please refer to the parent repository.

Thanks for stopping by! The original README is located in this repo at [README.old.md](./README.old.md).
